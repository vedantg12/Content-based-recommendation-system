# Content-based-recommendation-system
This repository contains my code for content based recommendation system built using LSH-Forest.
The data set that I have used in the code can be found on Kaggle, Kaggle has "Neural information Processing Systems(NIPS)" conference papers and I have used them. The link to these papers is https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/nips-papers.
